# Trading-algorithms-and-projects

This folder is dedicated to my personal trading and finance projects, which I have worked on and continue to work on for the following reasons:

1) To satisfy my personal investment interests.
   Writing programs that allow for the rapid backtesting of strategies that I am interested in implementing in my own trading accounts. These are real tools that I have used to assess the validity of trading strategies.

2) To gain relevant quantitative/trading skills that translate to what is required in real trading roles.
   Not only does this equip me with tangible skills so that I am better suited for the job, but it also demonstrates interest and competency, which helps to strengthen my applications.

3) Personal interest in coding and problem solving, and learning new skills.
   I thoroughly enjoy tackling challenging problems, especially those that are rooted in logic and mathematics. These projects allow me to expand my understanding of quantitative techniques, whilst deepening my coding skills.
